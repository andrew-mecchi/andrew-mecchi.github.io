# **D213 - Advanced Data Analytics**

## **Task 1: Time Series Analysis**
- Analysis Techniques Used
  - ARIMA
    - Model orders defined using autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF)
  - Revenue forecast plot based on ARIMA model
  - Calculate RMSE of model
  - Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity wtih seasonality, decomposition, and spectral density plots
    

**Summary:** The goal of this analysis is to create an ARIMA Time Series Analysis and project future revenues based on previous trends.
<br><br>
**Research Question:** Through the use of a time series analysis of the previous two-years of data, can daily revenues for the next two quarters (Q1 & Q2) be accurately forecasted?
<br><br>


## **Task 2: Sentiment Analysis**
**Summary:** The goal of this analysis is to use Natural Language Processing to determine customer sentiment based on reviews from Amazon, IMDB, and Yelp.
<br><br>
**Research Question:** Can the sentiment of a customer review be accurately predicted as positive or negative from a trained model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)?
