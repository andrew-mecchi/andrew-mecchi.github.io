# **D211 - Advanced Data Acquisition**

## **Task 1: Tableau and Connecting to PostGreSQL Database**

### **Summary** 
The goal of this project is to connect the internal WGU Telecom tables in PostGreSQL with an external dataset found through Kaggle. Once all tables have been uploaded to the SQL server, the data was manipulated to compare customer churn rates between two Telecom providers. The SQL code as well as csv files relevant for the project are available in this folder as well as a txt file whereby the SQL code was executed. Once the tables were connected, Tableau is used to link to PostGreSQL on WGU's "Labs on Demand" server.  

### **Research Question** 
What insights can be gained when comparing WGU Telecom and Kaggle Telecom customer churn rates between DSL and Fiber Optic services?


### **Analysis Techniques Used:**
- PostGreSQL 
  - Table creation (new and temporary)
  - Data entry modifications (rename/relabel values and features)
  - Update table (edit values within features)
  - Table union
