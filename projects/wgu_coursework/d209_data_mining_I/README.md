## **Task 1: K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier Analysis**

### **Summary** 
The primary goal of the analysis is to design an algorithm using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier and refine its performance with quantitative metrics suited to improve predictive accuracy. Implementing Select K Best as a feature selection method identifies the most suitable predictive features to include in the model. These selected features build the model and are optimized through hyperparameter analysis using GridSearhCV. The grid search results aid in the design of the final, optimized machine learning model.  

### **Research Question** 
Can the k-nearest neighbor classifier be used to accurately predict patient Readmissions?


### **Analysis Techniques Used:**
- K-Nearest Neighbor Classification
  - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Select K Best for feature selection
- Compute confusion matrix and visualize
- Performance Calculations: Accruacy, Precision, Sensitivity/Recall, Specificity
- Classificaiton report
- Plot ROC curve
- Calculate ROC-AUC score
