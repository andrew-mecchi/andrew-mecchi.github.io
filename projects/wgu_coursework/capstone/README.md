# **Predicting Term Deposit Success** 

## **Summary**
The goal of this analysis is to create a predictive model comparing logistic and random forest classifiers for term deposit success from imbalanced data using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE).

## **Hypothesis**
Null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>): A predictive model cannot classify customer deposits with statistical significance.

Alternate Hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>):  A predictive model can classify successful deposits from the given data with an F1 statistic that exceeds 0.3 or 30%.

## **Analysis Techniques Used**
  - Logistic Regression Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique
  - Model Evaluation
    - Calculate classification reports
    - Identify feature importances
    - Plot feature importances
